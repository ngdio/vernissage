# Vernissage

A portfolio website theme for photographers, artists, and designers using the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) static site generator. The template is built upon on [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev) and [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com).

The theme is based on the [photography portfolio](https://github.com/JoaoFranco03/photography-portfolio) originally created by [Jo√£o Franco](https://github.com/JoaoFranco03).

This project is currently a work in progress and under active development. Further blogging features are planned, including the dynamic import of images and building of captioned galleries using Eleventy features. Bug reports or feature requests are welcome - feel free to open an issue or drop me a message.
